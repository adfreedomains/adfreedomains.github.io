AdFree Domains Landing Page

Get this greedy domain registrars:
My domains, means my domains, and no registrar should advertise to my expense.
Period.

This message-wise landing page was created as a response to greedy domain registrars because think they can advertise for free in my own domains while I have them parked.
Asked from a certain "domain registrar" to give me the option to remove their unauthorized landing page from domains, which I paid, and their response was that there is no such an option.

There you have it, an adfree domain landing page now.

Feel free to use this message page as a protest to unauthorized use of your digital property..
Redirect to this landing page by going into your parked domain DNS settings, following your greedy registrar guide..
And there you have it - Your domains, means your property. Not a cash cow for greedy registrars.
