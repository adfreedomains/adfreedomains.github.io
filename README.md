AdFree Domains Landing Page

Get this greedy domain registrars:
My domains, means my domains, and no registrar should advertise to my expense.
Period.

I was forced to create this empty landing page because domain registrar think they can advertise for free in my own domains while I have them parked.
Asked from a certain "domain registrar" to give me the option to remove their unauthorized landing page from domains I pad and they said there is no such an option.

There you have an adfree domain landing page.

Feel free to use this landing page against greedy domain registrars or create your empty as a message to greedines.
